# VideoStreaming-and-Gaming <br />
The constore3.0 .net app is basically for the session storage usage, signalR implementation, Razor HTML front-end view, Jquery DOM, JS websocket client for NodeJS, and JS XHR client request sender. <br />
Consotre_Stream is the webapi for accessing video path info which was stored in the database currently. <br />
Consotre_Gaming is the webapi for accessing users' gaming data.<br />
File_server is NodeJS app only for Video File streaming, no database implementation.<br />
For the confidentiality, all code is demo, which means it is not the real project I made. Therefore, the source code of my real project would be unrevealed for now.
